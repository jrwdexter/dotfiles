; Use any ASCII printable characters (see characters 32-126 below)
; https://theasciicode.com.ar/ascii-printable-characters/space-ascii-code-32.html
; Limitations:
; - The backslash "\" cannot be used
; - Maximum 16 characters (for aesthetics: same length as flavor text)
; - Caps Lock does not work while the lock screen input is active. You can use
;   Shift for capitalizing characters instead.
